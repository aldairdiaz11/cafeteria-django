# Cafeteria Project

It’s time to choose some delicious desserts!

We’ve been hired by a school to work on an application for their cafeteria’s dessert options. The principal of the
school wants us to build a voting app that allows students to choose their favorite dessert for the upcoming week.

We have the skeleton of the application built, but we want to add a layer of authentication so that only authenticated
users can vote for dessert options, and only one admin can manage the app’s data.

We’ll end up working with the admin interface as well as implementing the whole authentication flow and adding a
security layer to our paths.
